Reduce image sizes in WordPress including NextGEN, GRAND FlAGallery, FooGallery and more using lossless/lossy methods and image format conversion.

== Description ==

The EWWW Image Optimizer is a WordPress plugin that will automatically optimize your images as you upload them to your blog. It can optimize the images that you have already uploaded, convert your images automatically to the file format that will produce the smallest image size (make sure you read the WARNINGS), and optionally apply lossy compression to achieve huge savings for PNG and JPG images.

**Why use EWWW Image Optimizer?**

1. **Your pages will load faster.** Smaller image sizes means faster page loads. This will make your visitors happy, and can increase revenue.
1. **Faster backups.** Smaller image sizes also means faster backups.
1. **Less bandwidth usage.** Optimizing your images can save you hundreds of KB per image, which means significantly less bandwidth usage.
1. **Super fast.** The plugin can run on your own server, so you donâ€™t have to wait for a third party service to receive, process, and return your images. You can optimize hundreds of images in just a few minutes. PNG files take the longest, but you can adjust the settings for your situation.
1. **Best JPG optimization.** With TinyJPG integration, nothing else comes close (requires an API subscription).
1. **Best PNG optimization.** You can use pngout, optipng, and pngquant in conjunction. And if that isn't enough, try the powerful TinyPNG option.
1. **Root access not needed** Pre-compiled binaries are made available to install directly within the Wordpress folder, and cloud optimization is provided for those who cannot run the binaries locally.
1. **Optimize everything** With the wp_image_editor class extension, and the ability to specify your own folders for scanning, any image in Wordpress can be optimized.

By default, EWWW Image Optimizer uses lossless optimization techniques, so your image quality will be exactly the same before and after the optimization. The only thing that will change is your file size. The one small exception to this is GIF animations. While the optimization is technically lossless, you will not be able to properly edit the animation again without performing an --unoptimize operation with gifsicle. The gif2png and jpg2png conversions are also lossless but the png2jpg process is not lossless. The lossy optimization for JPG and PNG files uses sophisticated algorithms to minimize perceptual quality loss, which is vastly different than setting a static quality/compression level.

The tools used for optimization are [jpegtran](http://jpegclub.org/jpegtran/), [TinyJPG](http://www.tinyjpg.com), [JPEGmini](http://www.jpegmini.com), [optipng](http://optipng.sourceforge.net/), [pngout](http://advsys.net/ken/utils.htm), [pngquant](http://pngquant.org/), [TinyPNG](http://www.tinypng.com), and [gifsicle](http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/). Most of these are freely available except TinyJPG/TinyPNG and JPEGmini. Images are converted using the above tools and one of the following: GMagick, IMagick, or GD.

EWWW Image Optimizer calls optimization utilities directly which is well suited to shared hosting situations where these utilities may already be installed. Pre-compiled binaries/executables are provided for optipng, gifsicle, pngquant, cwebp, and jpegtran. Pngout can be installed with one-click from the settings page. If none of that works, there is a cloud option that will work for any site.

If you need a version of this plugin for API use only, see [EWWW Image Optimizer Cloud](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ewww-image-optimizer-cloud/). It is much more compact as it does not contain any binaries or any mention of the exec() function.

= Support =

If you need assistance using the plugin, please visit our [Support Page](https://ewww.io/contact-us/). The forums are community supported only.
The EWWW Image Optimizer is developed at https://github.com/nosilver4u/ewww-image-optimizer

= Bulk Optimize =

Optimize all your images from a single page using the Bulk Scanner. This includes the Media Library, your theme, and a handful of pre-configured folders (see Optimize Everything Else below). Officially supported galleries (GRAND FlaGallery, NextCellent and NextGEN) have their own Bulk Optimize pages.

= Skips Previously Optimized Images =

All optimized images are stored in the database so that the plugin does not attempt to re-optimize them unless they are modified. On the Bulk Optimize page you can view a list of already optimized images. You may also remove individual images from the list, or use the Force optimize option to override the default behavior. The re-optimize links on the Media Library page also force the plugin to ignore the previous optimization status of images.

= WP Image Editor =

All images created by the built-in WP_Image_Editor class will be automatically optimized. Current implementations are GD, Imagick, and Gmagick. Images optimized via this class include Animated GIF Resize, BuddyPress Activity Plus (thumbs), Easy Watermark, Hammy, Imsanity, MediaPress, Meta Slider, MyArcadePlugin, OTF Regenerate Thumbnails, Regenerate Thumbnails, Simple Image Sizes, WP Retina 2x, WP RSS Aggregator and probably countless others. If you are not sure if a plugin uses WP_Image_Editor, send an inquiry on the support page.

= Optimize Everything Else =

Site admins can specify any folder within their WordPress folder to be optimized. The Bulk Scan under Media->Bulk Optimize will optimize theme images, BuddyPress avatars, BuddyPress Activity Plus images, Meta Slider slides, WP Symposium images, GD bbPress attachments, Grand Media Galleries, and any user-specified folders. Additionally, this tool can run on an hourly basis via wp_cron to keep newly uploaded images optimized. Scheduled optimization should not be used for any plugin that uses the built-in Wordpress image functions.

= WebP Images =

Can generate WebP versions of your images, and enables you to serve even smaller images to supported browsers. Several methods are available for serving WebP images, including Apache-compatible rewrite rules and our Alternative WebP Rewriting option compatible with caches and CDNs. Also works with the WebP option in the Cache Enabler plugin from KeyCDN.

= WP-CLI =

Allows you to run all Bulk Optimization processes from your command line, instead of the web interface. It is much faster, and allows you to do things like run it in 'screen' or via regular cron (instead of wp-cron, which can be unpredictable on low-traffic sites). Install WP-CLI from wp-cli.org, and run 'wp-cli.phar help ewwwio optimize' for more information.

= FooGallery =

All images uploaded and cached by FooGallery are automatically optimized. Previous uploads can be optimized by running the Media Library Bulk Optimize. Previously cached images can be optimized by entering the wp-content/uploads/cache/ folder under Folders to Optimize and running a Scan & Optimize from the Bulk Optimize page.

= NextGEN Gallery =

Features optimization on upload capability, re-optimization, and bulk optimizing. The NextGEN Bulk Optimize function is located near the bottom of the NextGEN menu, and will optimize all images in all galleries. It is also possible to optimize groups of images in a gallery, or multiple galleries at once.

= NextCellent Gallery =

Features all the same capability as NextGEN, and is the continuation of legacy (1.9.x) NextGEN support.

= GRAND Flash Album Gallery =

Features optimization on upload capability, re-optimization, and bulk optimizing. The Bulk Optimize function is located near the bottom of the FlAGallery menu, and will optimize all images in all galleries. It is also possible to optimize groups of images in a gallery, or multiple galleries at once.

= Image Store =

Uploads are automatically optimized. Look for Optimize under the Image Store (Galleries) menu to see status of optimization and for re-optimization and bulk-optimization options. Using the Bulk Optimization tool under Media Library automatically includes all Image Store uploads.

= CDN Support =

Uploads to Amazon S3, Azure Storage, Cloudinary, and DreamSpeed CDN are optimized. All pull mode CDNs like Cloudflare, KeyCDN, MaxCDN, and Sucuri CloudProxy are also supported.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'ewww-image-optimizer' plugin to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Ensure jpegtran, optipng, pngout and gifsicle are installed on your Linux server (basic installation instructions are below if they are not). You will receive a warning when you activate the plugin if they are not present. This message will go away once you have them installed.
1. The plugin will attempt to install jpegtran, optipng, and gifsicle automatically for you. This requires that the wp-content folder is writable by the user running the web server.
1. If the automatic install did not work, find the appropriate binaries for your system in the ewww-image-optimizer plugin folder, copy them to wp-content/ewww/ and remove the OS 'tag' (like -linux or -fbsd). No renaming is necessary on Windows, just copy the .exe files to the wp-content/ewww folder. IMPORTANT: Do not symlink or modify the binaries in any way, or they will not pass the security checks. If you transfer files via FTP, be sure to transfer in binary mode, not ascii or text.
1. If the binaries don't run locally, you can sign up for the EWWW IO cloud service to run them via our optimization servers: https://ewww.io/plans/
1. *Recommended* Visit the settings page to enable/disable specific tools and turn on advanced optimization features.
1. Done!

If these steps do not work, additional documentation is available at https://docs.ewww.io. If you need further assistance using the plugin, please visit our [Support Page](https://ewww.io/contact-us/). The forums are community supported only.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Google Pagespeed says my images need compressing or resizing, but I already optimized all my images. What do I do? =

Try this for starters: http://docs.ewww.io/article/5-pagespeed-says-my-images-need-more-work

= The plugin complains that I'm missing something, what do I do? =

This article will walk you through installing the required tools (and the alternatives if installation does not work): http://docs.ewww.io/article/6-the-plugin-says-i-m-missing-something

= Does the plugin replace existing images? =

Yes, but only if the optimized version is smaller. The plugin should NEVER create a larger image.

= Can I resize my images with this plugin? =

Yes, you can, set it up on the Advanced tab.

= Can I lower the compression setting for JPGs to save more space? =

The lossy JPG optimization using TinyJPG and JPEGmini will determine the ideal quality setting and give you the best results, but you can also adjust the default quality for conversion and resizing. More information here: http://docs.ewww.io/article/12-jpq-quality-and-wordpress

= The bulk optimizer doesn't seem to be working, what can I do? =

If it doesn't seem to work at all, check for javascript problems using the developer console in Firefox or Chrome. If it is not working just on some images, you may need to increase the setting max_execution_time in your php.ini file. There are also other timeouts with Apache, and possibly other limitations of your webhost. If you've tried everything else, the last thing to look for is large PNG files. In my tests on a shared hosting setup, "large" is anything over 300 KB. You can first try decreasing the PNG optimization level in the settings. If that doesn't work, perhaps you ought to convert that PNG to JPG or set a max PNG optimization size. Screenshots are often done as PNG files, but that is a poor choice for anything with photographic elements.
[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4U2hQlmkvQ]

= What are the supported operating systems? =

I've tested it on Windows (with Apache), Linux, Mac OSX, FreeBSD 9, and Solaris (v10). The cloud API will work on any OS.

= How are JPGs optimized? =

Lossless optimization is done with the command *jpegtran -copy all -optimize -progressive -outfile optimized-file original-file*. Optionally, the -copy switch gets the 'none' parameter if you choose to strip metadata from your JPGs on the options page. Lossy optimization is done using the outstanding TinyJPG and JPEGmini utilities.

= How are PNGs optimized? =

There are three parts (and all are optional). First, using the command *pngquant original-file*, then using the commands *pngout-static -s2 original-file* and *optipng -o2 original-file*. You can adjust the optimization levels for both tools on the settings page. Optipng is an automated derivative of pngcrush, which is another widely used png optimization utility. EWWW I.O. Cloud uses TinyPNG for 10% better lossy compression than standalone pngquant.

= How are GIFs optimized? =

Using the command *gifsicle -b -O3 --careful original file*. This is particularly useful for animated GIFs, and can also streamline your color palette. That said, if your GIF is not animated, you should strongly consider converting it to a PNG. PNG files are almost always smaller, they just don't do animations. The following command would do this for you on a Linux system with imagemagick: *convert somefile.gif somefile.png*

= I want to know more about image optimization, and why you chose these options/tools. =

That's not a question, but since I made it up, I'll answer it. See these resources:
http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#opt_images
https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/OptimizeImages

Pngout, TinyJPG/TinyPNG, JPEGmini, and Pngquant were recommended by EWWW IO users. Pngout (usually) optimizes better than Optipng, and best when they are used together. TinyJPG is the best lossy compression tool that I have found for JPG images. Pngquant is an excellent lossy optimizer for PNGs, and is one of the tools used by TinyPNG.

== Screenshots ==

1. Plugin settings page.
2. Additional optimize column added to media listing. You can see your savings, manually optimize individual images, and restore originals (converted only).
3. Bulk optimization page. You can optimize all your images at once and resume a previous bulk optimization. This is very useful for existing blogs that have lots of images.

== Changelog ==

* I no longer have a Mac with which to build new binaries. Until I can raise enough funds, there will be no more updates for the Mac OS X tools, and I may have to temporarily remove Mac support if any security issues arise in the meantime: https://www.gofundme.com/ewww-image-optimizer-mac-dev-laptop
